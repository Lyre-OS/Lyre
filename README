lyre
====

lyre is a kernel and distro which aims at running xfce.

Yes, running xfce is lyre's main goal.

Building
========

Build the distro first, which includes toolchain and everything lyre needs with
this command:

  make distro

Then build the kernel and image with:

  make

Try it in qemu with:

  make run

(it needs KVM because lyre depends on certain modern CPU features not emulated
by qemu)
